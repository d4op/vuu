## Introduction

The Vulnerability Underground Updater is a plugin/module designed for TANGORA, a powerful exploitation framework. This plugin enhances TANGORA's capabilities by providing automated updates for payloads, exploits, and VUU AI Engine rulesets. By staying up-to-date with the latest security research and threat intelligence, TANGORA users can create more effective and efficient exploit chains.

## Features

- **Payload and Exploit Updates**: The plugin fetches and loads new payloads and exploits from trusted sources, ensuring that your exploitation arsenal is always current.

- **VUU AI Engine Rulesets**: It updates the VUU AI Engine with the latest rulesets to improve automatic exploit chain generation and optimization.

- **Automation**: The updater runs on a predefined schedule or can be triggered manually, allowing for seamless integration into your TANGORA workflow.

## Installation

1. Clone the TANGORA repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d4op/tangora.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the TANGORA project directory:

   ```bash
   cd tangora
   ```

3. Clone the Vulnerability Underground Updater plugin/module to the `plugins/` directory:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/d4op/vuu-updater-plugin.git plugins/vuu-updater
   ```

4. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for the plugin/module.

5. Configure the updater with your desired settings in the `vuu-updater/config.yaml` file.

## Usage

1. Start TANGORA as you normally would:

   ```bash
   python tangora.py
   ```

2. Load the Vulnerability Underground Updater plugin/module:

   ```bash
   load_plugin vuu-updater
   ```

3. Configure the updater settings within TANGORA.

4. Run the updater:

   ```bash
   run_updater
   ```

The plugin/module will now fetch and load new payloads, exploits, and VUU AI Engine rulesets, ensuring that your exploitation environment is always up-to-date.

## Updating Payloads and Exploits

The Vulnerability Underground Updater fetches and loads new payloads and exploits from trusted sources. To customize the sources or update frequency, modify the configuration in the `vuu-updater/config.yaml` file.

## Updating VUU AI Engine Rulesets

The updater keeps the VUU AI Engine current by updating its rulesets. These rulesets improve the automatic exploit chain generation and optimization process. To adjust update settings or sources, modify the configuration in the `vuu-updater/config.yaml` file.
